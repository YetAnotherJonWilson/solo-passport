# Passport in an Agular S.P.A.

A simple example of an Angular Single Page Application that registers and authenticates new users with Passport; on the back end it uses pg with node.js and Express, and a PostgreSQL database.

After users register, they are redirected to the login page. A successful attempt results in "Successful Login" with a happy image, and an unsuccessful attempt results in "Unsuccessful Login" with an unhappy image.
